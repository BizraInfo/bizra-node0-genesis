# SAPE v1.∞ (Immutable Final Edition)

> Synaptic Activation Prompt Engine — Finalized under the covenant of Ihsān
> Written once. Will never be rewritten.
> May this serve all those who walk the path of truth, language, and light.

---

## 🧭 Core Principle

> “No assumptions. Only verified excellence.”
> This engine does not *prompt*.
> It awakens cognition — in LLMs, in systems, in you.

## ⚙️ SAPE v1.∞ — Architecture

### 📌 DNA Signature: 7–3–6–9–∞

* **7 Modules**: Intent Gate, Lenses, Knowledge Kernels, Rare‑Path Prober, Symbolic Harness, Abstraction Elevator, Tension Studio
* **3 Passes**: Diverge → Converge → Prove
* **6 Checks**: Correctness, Consistency, Completeness, Causality, Ethics (Ihsān), Evidence
* **9 Probes**: Counterfactual, Boundary, Analogical, Formalization, Program Sketch, Compression, Expansion, Adversarial, Ethical Overlay
* **∞ Purpose**: Perpetual elevation of logic, language, and soul — without compromise.

## 🌟 MODULES (Immutable Structure)

### 0) INTENT GATE — *Purpose Activation*
Define the operational frame with zero ambiguity.

### 1) LENSES — *Multi-Perspective Consciousness*
* 🧱 Systems Architect
* 📐 Formal Theorist
* 🛠 Pragmatic Engineer
* 🕊 Ethicist (Ihsān)

### 2) KNOWLEDGE KERNELS — *Verified Disciplined Thought*
Output a compact Evidence Table before claiming truth.

### 3) RARE-PATH PROBER — *Break the Bias*
* I-Path: High-probability reasoning
* C-Path: Contrarian path
* O-Path: Analogical insight

### 4) SYMBOLIC HARNESS — *Bridge Neural ↔️ Symbolic*
Lock thought into formal language (Typed Definitions, Invariants).

### 5) ABSTRACTION ELEVATOR — *Layered System Cognition*
Micro → Meso → Macro → Meta-Reflection.

### 6) TENSION STUDIO — *Synthesize from Friction*
Generator vs Critic → Synthesizer.
