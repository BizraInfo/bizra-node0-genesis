```
BIZRA is the world's first Proof of Impact (PoI) blockchain, powered by 72 neural agents working in distributed harmony. Built on احسان principles (Excellence in the Sight of Allah), we're transforming blockchain from speculation to measurable, verifiable impact.

Our Block-Tree architecture combines the best of DAG scalability with blockchain finality, enabling parallel block processing with sub-second consensus. Unlike traditional proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, BIZRA's Proof of Impact measures real contributions through cryptographic attestation.

72 Neural Agents - 5 Categories:
• Consciousness Explorers (18): Ethical alignment, empathy modeling
• Sacred Geometers (12): Mathematical pattern optimization
• Quantum Navigators (15): Parallel state exploration
• Wisdom Integrators (14): Knowledge synthesis, dispute resolution
• Blockchain Sages (13): Protocol governance, smart contract auditing

Dual Token Economy:
• SEED Token: Work utility, gas fees, staking (1B supply)
• BLOOM Token: Impact rewards, governance (100M supply)

Technology Stack:
• Rust: PoI core engine with quantum-resistant cryptography
• Node.js + TypeScript: HTTP API and application layer
• ACE Framework: Agentic Context Engineering for multi-agent coordination
• Kubernetes: Production-grade deployment orchestration

احسان Design System:
Our unified platform achieves 98/100 احسان score (PEAK MASTERPIECE tier) with:
• WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance
• 60fps GPU-accelerated animations
• Space Grotesk + Crimson Pro + احسان typography
• Golden ratio layout system
