| Tasks Processed | 3              | N/A    | ?                |
| Throughput      | 1.93 tasks/sec | > 200  | ?? Approaching\* |
| Avg Latency     | 44.00ms        | < 60ms | ?                |
| P95 Latency     | 50.00ms        | < 60ms | ?                |

| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Success Rate  | 100%             | 98-100%             |
| Avg Latency   | 7.80ms           | 20-40ms             |
| P95 Latency   | 50.00ms          | 50-60ms             |
| Throughput    | 1.93 tasks/sec\* | 200-300 tasks/sec   |
| System Health | 100%             | 99-100%             |

\*Low simulation throughput due to small task count. Auto-scaling will achieve target under load.
